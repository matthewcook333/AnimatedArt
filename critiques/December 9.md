# Critique for week ending on December 7th

You didn't have any specific questions for me, so here goes!

I'll first address my reaction to using various parts the language. Note that these comments are just immediate reactions and really don't take the remaining time scale into account.
* Drawing the path was relatively easy, and I like that you made the image turn around when it reaches the end, this makes the visuals less jerk-y.
  * I wish I could erase part of a path, or start over. Could there be a way to select the path and delete/move/rotate/edit it, instead of just adding to it?
  * I also kinda wish I could close a path, so that it goes around in a loop, without ever needing to turn around. 
* The rotation bit was cool. It seems you've added the stacking animation aspect for this, but haven't yet allowed them to be chained. Are you still considering letting people decide '2s of rotation - 2s of nothing - 1 sec of CCW rotation' or something?

For the program as a whole, I found it relatively easy to use. I wish there was a way to select images to add, instead of it being automatically Ben - Ran - Ran - Ran... I know this is tough, but if every time someone hits "done" you show them a "shape/image select" option that has some stock images but allow people to choose which one to go with, that would be awesome.

In general, I think you've made a ton of progress and have quite a bit to show for it. Good job!

If I have a main concern for your project that you could focus on in the last week, it's that it doesn't currently really feel like a language, as much as an app. I think the things that give me the impression are the following: being unable to edit things after having hit "Done!" (a program in most languages is a work in progress, continuously up for edits, in my experience and resulting expectation), being unable to change or at least delete the current path and start over, and having the type of image decided for you. Many of these things are aspects of this language being incomplete, obviously, but they are what stick out to me.

Good luck in your last week!
