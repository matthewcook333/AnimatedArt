##Introduction##

Animations are an important form of visual art, one that allows for a variety of creative outlets.
The typical way to create animations is through frame-by-frame static images, and stringing them together
to create a moving picture. The purpose of my Domain-Specific Language is to allow users to easily create
simple animations without the need to creating repetitive images. For simple animations, there may only
be a number of actions the user would need, and so this could be done through simply describing what
those animations are, rather than drawing out each frame.

The DSL will be used as a tool with an interactive canvas to allow the user to draw an image, and then 
describe what they want it to do, such as rotate or oscillate in some way. Doing so, they can easily 
make a moving image without the need to draw all of the frames of that action. The user interacts with
the language through a graphical interface, making it easy for the user to draw what they would like,
and simply tap any of the animations at their disposal without needing to learn the language ahead
of time.
